			Going on a trip and need someone to take care of your beloved fur baby?
			Is a busy schedule getting in the way of giving your best friend the
			excercise they need? I could be just the thing you need! <br>
			Hello, I'm Maya. I have over a decade of experience being the 
			primary caretaker of both dogs and cats. I also have experience 
			with small pets such as birds, hamsters, and fish. Here at Pampered 
			Pooch I strive for top quality care and want to give your pet 
			the attention they deserve.

		<h4>Walking</h4>

		<p>
			With modern day life getting more and more fast paced, it can be hard
			to find the time in your week to provide the amount of excercise and
			excitement a dog needs to stay healthy and happy. Not having enough
			excersice can leave a dog restless, anxious, and more prone to
			aggression. But don't fret! That's why I am here to make sure your dog
			has more than enough enrichment, leaving both you and your dog less
			stress, and so for the quality time you do spend together, your pet
			is already feeling happy and satisfied rather than cranky. <br>
			My rates are 15$ per walk, 12$ if it's 3 or more days a week. 
			Please send me a message in the contact section to arrange a timeslot.

		<h4>Pet Sitting</h4>

			If you're going to be away and need someone to watch your pet, why not make sure to
			leave them in the care of someone experienced. Pet sitting services start at 25$ per day
			and 150$ per week. Please send me a message in the contact section to schedule your pet's care.
