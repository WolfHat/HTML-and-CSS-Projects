			Going on a trip and need someone to take care of your beloved fur baby?
			Is a busy schedule getting in the way of giving your best friend the
			excercise they need? I could be just the thing you need! <br>
			Hello, I'm Maya. I have over a decade of experience being the
			primary caretaker of both dogs and cats. I also have experience
			with small pets such as birds, hamsters, and fish. Here at Pampered
			Pooch I strive for top quality care and want to give your pet
			the attention they deserve.

					With modern day life getting more and more fast paced, it can be hard
					to find the time in your week to provide the amount of excercise and
					excitement a dog needs to stay healthy and happy. Not having enough
					excersice can leave a dog restless, anxious, and more prone to
					aggression. But don't fret! That's why I am here to make sure your dog
					has more than enough enrichment, leaving both you and your dog less
					stress, and so for the quality time you do spend together, your pet
					is already feeling happy and satisfied rather than cranky. <br>
					My rates are 15$ per walk, 12$ if it's 3 or more days a week.
					Please send me a message in the contact section to arrange a timeslot.

					If you're going to be away and need someone to watch your pet, why not make sure to
					leave them in the care of someone experienced. Pet sitting services start at 25$ per day
					and 150$ per week. Please send me a message in the contact section to schedule your pet's care.
