		<h2>The Five Stages of Grief</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Denial: No no, of course cereal isn't soup, that's just silly.</li>
			<li>Anger: What? Now you're being ridiculous. You can't even eat it, it's too hot!</li>
			<li>Bargaining: If I agree hot chocolate is a soup will you leave me alone?</li>
			<li>Depression: Now I'll never be able to eat salad the same way again...</li>
			<li>Acceptance: Fine. Guess I'll bring my spoons next time I go to the beach then.</li>
