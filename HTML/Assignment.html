		<h1>Who would be better engineers? Cats, or Giraffes?</h1>
		<main>
		<p>
		Ah, yes. The great debate. Engineers everywhere have pondered this very important question.
		Who can be trusted with such a vital and dangerous task? In the name of science, we expect
		to tackle this question today, so that society as a whole can at last rest in relief, knowing the answer.

		<h3>The Purrfect Choice: The Cat's side of things</h3>
		<p>
		The purr-os of having cats is that they are already used to being up at night, meaning they can work on construction at the least invasive time to the rest of society, without damaging their mental or physical health.
		They are also notoriously good climbers; an essential skill when building things that are high up. Governments will save thousands on workplace injury claims as falling
		from such heights will seldom cause much damage. Anti-cat folk, however, argue that this is a double-edged sword. Their lack of perspective on what it means to fear the pain of falling may render them careless when
		designing a bridge. Why would they sweat about structeral integrity if they know that, should the bridge fall, they would all be safe anyways? However, there is evidence that cats do enjoy bridges made by humans,
		as shown by this video. Why shouldn't they take as much care when building a bridge for us?

		Even more impassioned Girraffe supporters argue that the widespread catnip addiction
		epidemic would render cats more likely to be under the influence on the job. Cat supporters counter that this is nothing but a baseless shutdown based in predjudice. But what does sience have to say? Here is a quote from hillspet.com:
		</p>
		<blockquote cite="https://www.hillspet.com/cat-care/behavior-appearance/how-smart-are-cats">
		As noted in Psychology Today by Dr. Berit Brogaard, "cats have more nerve cells in the visual areas of their brain,
		a part of the cerebral cortex [the area of the brain responsible for decision-making, problem-solving, planning, memory,
		and language-processing], than humans and most other mammals."
